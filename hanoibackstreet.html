                <h1>Hanoi and the backstreet-of-everything <sup>2024</h1>
                <h3>Mini Display — Mixed Media</h3>
                <p class="entry" >
                    Back in the days, my grandparents once told me a funny quote <b>“Nhà nhà đục tường, người người ra
                    đường”</b> which can roughly be translated to <b></b>“Everybody breaches their walls as everyone comes into the
                    streets”</b>. Growing up in a close-to-city-center neighborhood in Hanoi, I took it for granted: almost
                    every house on the street would be for commercial purposes. People would use every spare space left
                    to build something and make a living. Sidewalk service varies from sidewalk restaurants, ice tea,
                    and BBQ to sidewalk barbers. But when it comes to sidewalk barbers, it hits me differently. People
                    would eat and drink in a hurry, but we wouldn't do our hair in such a manner. I always encountered
                    sidewalk barbers in such a peaceful and calming context, and I wondered why.
                </p>
                <p class="entry" >
                    At the front of the street, we have shops, several significant buildings' gates, and all. It might
                    be just an alley at the back, and nothing happens there. But what happens when, at the back, there
                    is another street? People would start using this area, but not by breaching the walls, and that is
                    where sidewalk barbers appear. Moreover, this naturally happens when a large site with an unoccupied
                    backside takes place, such as a school, workplace, or parking lot. The surrounding area seems
                    spacious during midday because there are almost no storefronts. The surrounding area is also pretty
                    quiet during midday because of a school or workplace nearby. All these factors create a fascinating
                    scene: people having their hair cut at a sidewalk barber, completely relaxing and calming during
                    midday on an&nbsp;uncrowded&nbsp;street.
                </p>
                <img class="entry" src="assets/media/works/Hanoi/back_front.png">
                <p class="entry" >
                    Gradually, other sidewalk services appear, such as an iced tea booth or a BBQ stall. But not once do
                    these backstreets get overcrowded. All these services operate during the daytime, then slowly
                    immersed in the heavy traffic as the sun goes down. On some days, there might be nothing going on.
                    The barber's mirror and the iced tea maker's furnishings might still be left there, and they would
                    come back at any time. The space is reasonably used, but it never grows out of that. I name it <b>“the
                    backstreet corner of everything”</b>.
                </p>
                <p class="entry" >
                    When I came across the word <b>“The instant mega-city”</b>, I just interpreted it as my grandparents'
                    quote. People are building up things constantly to provide sufficient mobility and service for the
                    increasing population. But some things remained untouched, like the sidewalk barber on the
                    backstreet. There might be an iced tea booth nearby or a BBQ stall. It is a small business, and it
                    never becomes more significant than that, maybe as long as no one breaches the nearby walls.
